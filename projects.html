                <p class="proj-p">
                    One of my favorite board games is dominion. 
                    In an effort to overdo a final class project, I decided to try and write the game in rust for <em>educational</em> purposes, using the terminal. <br><br>
                    I implemented about half of the cards in "First game," along with a CPU opponent that plays a simple strategy called "Big money" <br><br>
                    Considering the standards for this project was a terminal-style command interface, and I was working alone, I'm proud of the outcome. <br><br>

                <p class="proj-p">
                    During my algorithms class, an extra credit assignment was to implement any complex algorithms discussed. <br><br> 
                    I jumped on this as a challenge during the last day to see what I could get done in six hours, and was impressed with the results.

                <p class="proj-p">
                    Group project where me and a teammate created a graph using a large google dataset.
                    We were able to manually calculate several properties, including
                    centrality, distance, and a minnimum spanning tree.<br><br>

                    I served on making most of the fundemental algorithms, as well as researching the underlying Swing Java UI.

                <p class="proj-p">
                    This site was hand-built using CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I read the book "CSS in Depth" by Keith J. Grant, 
                    and learned a bunch about making sites, so now I have no excuse for writing bad ones.

                    This is my ongoing senior group-project to provide technical support and a mobile application for an engineering team's easy-lifting robot.<br><br>
                    I served as the scrummaster for a team of six during the first 3/4s of the project. During the project, I got the chance to learn Android development, compose UI, Hilt dependency injection, the ROS package manager, and more.

                    This is an abandoned Game design project that tested the limits of how far I could push physics calculations and proper gravity handling.<br><br>
                    As the only programmer on this project, I wrote the entire player movement, physics, gravity, and rotation from scratch, so a player could move around a 2d sphere.<br><br>
                    This project made me familiar with cross-class signaling, modern application architecture, and some nuances of OpenGL and resolution handling.<br><br>
                    Godot isn't built for games that center around spherical coordinates without heavy modification, so the project is on hold until I can aquire some skills, and make a return.<br><br>
                    
                    This game also had a number of lovely art assets and animations done by someone who doesn't have a portfolio link, so I can't show off their art! :(
